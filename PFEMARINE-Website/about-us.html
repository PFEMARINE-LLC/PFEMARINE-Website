        <h2>Our Story &amp; Philosophy</h2>
        <div class="editorial-body">
          <p>
            PFEMARINE LLC stands at the intersection of modern cloud engineering, 
            large-scale IT operations, and community-centered impact. We have seen 
            firsthand how technology can unlock new possibilities—and how, without 
            guidance, it can also become a barrier for organizations already stretched thin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rather than selling generic “solutions,” we focus on <strong>listening</strong> 
            first: to your mission, your constraints, your people, and the communities 
            you serve. From there, we architect cloud, data, security, and productivity 
            platforms that respect your budget, your capacity, and your culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our work is rooted in <strong>Integrity</strong>: we communicate clearly, set 
            realistic expectations, and recommend only what we believe will move you forward. 
            We design with <strong>Equity</strong> in mind, aware that digital transformation 
            can deepen existing gaps if it is not handled thoughtfully. And we operate with 
            <strong>Respect</strong>—for your time, your staff, your mission, and your lived 
            experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Internally, we commit to <strong>Inclusivity</strong>, <strong>Diversity</strong>, 
            and a <strong>Growth-Mindset</strong>. Our team blends backgrounds in 
            enterprise IT, non-profit support, education, and community work. We learn 
            continuously, adapt quickly, and bring that same mindset into every engagement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether we are standing up secure identities, migrating workloads to Azure, 
            modernizing monitoring, or building analytics that tell the story of your impact, 
            our promise is consistent: <strong>we will treat your mission as if it were our own.</strong>

        <h2>Who We Serve &amp; Where We See the Need</h2>
        <p>
          PFEMARINE focuses on organizations where technology is mission-critical 
          but in-house resources are limited. We pay special attention to markets 
          where digital enrichment can have an outsized impact:
        </p>
        <div class="about-markets-grid">
          <div class="market-card">
            <h3>Non-Profits &amp; Community Organizations</h3>
            <p>
              Donor management, reporting, compliance, and collaboration all depend 
              on stable, secure IT. We help non-profits modernize without losing sight 
              of their mission or budget.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="market-card">
            <h3>Education &amp; Youth Services</h3>
            <p>
              From learning platforms to secure communications, education and youth-focused 
              organizations rely on reliable, accessible technology to serve students, 
              families, and staff.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="market-card">
            <h3>Healthcare &amp; Human Services</h3>
            <p>
              Healthcare and human services require strong identity, governance, and data 
              protection. We align cloud and security practices with regulatory expectations.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="market-card">
            <h3>Small Businesses &amp; Startups</h3>
            <p>
              Small teams often carry enterprise-level responsibility on startup-level 
              capacity. We design right-sized, scalable environments that grow as you grow.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="market-card">
            <h3>Government &amp; Public Sector</h3>
            <p>
              Public-sector organizations face unique security, compliance, and budget 
              constraints. Our experience in this space helps bridge policy, process, 
              and technical implementation.
